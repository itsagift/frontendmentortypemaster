## My process

I was pleasantly surprised with my ability to complete this one in a timely manner. I started with vanilla CSS but decided it would be a good opportunity to use SCSS. 

The one thing I would've done different next time is use a mobile first workflow. Just would've simplified everything. 

### Built with

- HTML 
- BEM (sorta!)
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I think I really got more used to CSS Grid. Even though I learned it about a year ago, I don't use it all the time, and I'm sometimes pretty rusty. I had to troubleshoot a few grid issues and it worked out okay. I also noticed several places where my code was redundant or too complicated, which made me feel better about my skills. 

### Continued development

I definitely want to become a grid master after this! 

### Useful resources

- [Grid Layoutit](https://grid.layoutit.com/) - I've been using this for a while. Maybe a bit of a cheat, but I like to visualize my grid and grid areas before writing my HTML.
